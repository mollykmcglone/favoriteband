      <p>Don't make me read your mind
          You should know me better than that
          It takes me too much time
          You should know me better than that
          You're not that much like me
          You should know me better than that
          We have different enemies
          You should know me better than that
          I should leave it alone but you're not right
          I should leave it alone but you're not right <br><br>
          Can't you write it on a wall
          You should know me better than that
          There's no room to write it all
          You should know me better than that<br><br>
          Can you turn the TV down
          You should know me better than that
          There's too much crying in the sound
          I should know you better than that
          I should leave it alone but you're not right
          I should leave it alone but you're not right

        I should live in salt for leaving you behind
        Behind<br><br>
        Think about something so much
          You should know me better than that
          Start to slide out of touch
          You should know me better than that
          Tell yourself it's all you know
          You should know me better than that
          Learn to appreciate the void
          You should know me better than that<br><br>

          I should live in salt for leaving you behind
          Behind
          I should live in salt for leaving you behind
          Behind<br><br>
